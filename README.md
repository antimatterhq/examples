# Antimatter usage examples

This repository is a collection of a few examples showing how Antimatter can be used.

We currently support Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12. The python examples are structured as Jupyter Notebooks, so you will need to install and run jupyter:

```bash
pip install jupyter
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

Once opening the notebook server in your browser, you can open any notebook examples.
